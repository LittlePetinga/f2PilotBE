\description{
\code{f2()} calculates the \eqn{f_2} Similarity Factor, as proposed by Moore and Flanner in 1996.
}
\details{
The similarity \eqn{f_2} factor is a mathematical index widely used to compare dissolution
profiles, evaluating their similarity, using the percentage of drug dissolved per unit of time.

The similarity \eqn{f_2} factor, proposed by Moore and Flanner in 1996, is derived from the
mean squared difference, and can be calculated as a function of the reciprocal of mean squared-root
transformation of the sum of square differences at all points:
\deqn{
  {f_2} = 50 \cdot \log \left( 100 \cdot \left[ 1 + \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{t=n} \left(\overline{R}_t
  - \overline{T}_t\right)^2 \right]^{-0.5} \right)
}
where \eqn{f_2} is the similarity factor, \eqn{n} is the number of time points, and \eqn{{\overline{R}_t}}
and \eqn{{\overline{T}_t}} are the mean percentage of drug dissolved at time \eqn{t} after initiation of
the study, for Reference and Test products, respectively.

The \eqn{f_2} similarity factor ranges from 0 (when \eqn{{\overline{R}_t} - {\overline{T}_t} = 100\%}, at
all \eqn{t}) to 100 (when \eqn{{\overline{R}_t} - {\overline{T}_t} = 0\%}, at all \eqn{t}).
