Description: Contains functions to calculate the similarity factor f2
    based on pharmacokinetic profiles from pilot bioequivalence studies,
    as an alternative approach to assess the potential of bioequivalence
    of a Test product in comparison to a Reference product in terms of
    Cmax and AUC.
